# AI-Traffic Surveillance 

Our solution goes beyond basic traffic monitoring. It uses AI and computer vision to automatically scan and recognize number plates, and to detect:
- Bikers riding without a helmet
- Car drivers without a seat belt
- Overspeeding vehicles
- Vehicles jumping traffic signals

The system generates real-time alerts for rule violations, automates evidence capture, and enables data-driven enforcement for safer roads.
