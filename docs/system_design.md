# System Design

- ML: YOLOv8 detection + simple tracker, EasyOCR for plates, OpenCV enhancement, speed estimation via pixel_per_meter + fps.
- Backend: FastAPI with endpoints, SQLite/Postgres via SQLAlchemy, evidence stored on disk or S3.
- Frontend: React + Tailwind admin with live upload and feeds.
- Queue/Cache: Redis (optional).
